    <span class="soybean-meal-hover">Soybean Meal</span> is a high-protein byproduct of soybean crushing, crucial for the global livestock and poultry industries:
    <ul>
      <li>Primary source of protein feed for cattle, pigs, and poultry</li>
      <li>Vital for meat and dairy production worldwide</li>
      <li>Exported heavily from major producers like the U.S. and Brazil</li>
    </ul>
    Soybean meal prices reflect agricultural productivity and global protein demand.  
    They are influenced by:
    <ul>
      <li>Livestock production trends and animal feed demand</li>
      <li>Weather conditions affecting soybean harvests</li>
      <li>Competition from alternative protein meals (e.g., rapeseed meal)</li>
      <li>Global trade flows and regional feedstock shortages</li>
    </ul>
    As a staple input in animal nutrition, soybean meal is a key driver of agricultural trade and food supply chains around the world.
