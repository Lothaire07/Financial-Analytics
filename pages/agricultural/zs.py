        <span class="soy-hover">Soybeans</span> are a globally important oilseed crop, playing a central role in food, animal feed, and industrial applications:
        <ul>
          <li>Crushed into soybean meal for livestock and poultry feed</li>
          <li>Processed into soybean oil, used in food and biofuel industries</li>
          <li>Exported massively by the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina</li>
        </ul>
        Soybeans are not only a key food commodity but also a strategic trade asset in global agriculture.  
        Their price is influenced by:
        <ul>
          <li>Weather conditions across key producing regions</li>
          <li>Global demand for protein (feed and food)</li>
          <li>Biofuel policies affecting soybean oil usage</li>
          <li>Geopolitical factors and trade relations (notably U.S.â€“China)</li>
        </ul>
        As one of the "big three" crops in agricultural futures (alongside corn and wheat), soybeans are actively traded and highly sensitive to shifts in global supply chains and consumption trends.
