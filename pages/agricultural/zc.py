        <span class="corn-hover">Corn</span> is one of the most widely produced and traded agricultural commodities in the world, serving as a vital input for both food and energy markets:
        <ul>
          <li>Used as livestock feed, human food, and industrial starch</li>
          <li>A major component in biofuel production, especially ethanol</li>
          <li>Traded globally, with the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina as top exporters</li>
        </ul>
        Corn prices reflect both agricultural fundamentals and broader macroeconomic forces.  
        They are influenced by:
        <ul>
          <li>Weather patterns and crop yields (e.g., droughts or floods)</li>
          <li>Global demand for feed, food, and fuel</li>
          <li>Government policies, subsidies, and biofuel mandates</li>
          <li>Export competition and trade agreements</li>
        </ul>
        As a benchmark agricultural future, corn is a key indicator of global food supply and demand dynamics â€” closely monitored by traders, economists, and policymakers alike.
